###### Inspired by GitHub repo [Awesome Windows](https://github.com/Awesome-Windows/Awesome)

The purpose of this book is to introduce awesome apps on Windows. These apps here all meet condition listed on our [Org home](http://amazingapps.org/#two)

Note: Apps that meet the following conditions will NOT be listed although they may deserve a try:

1. Modified or cracked versions of an app, such as unofficial ad-free versions which can provide a better user experience than the original versions. This rule does not apply to modifications permitted by the open-source license.
2. Apps that are useful only in limited areas, such as NPR One and IME.
3. Apps that are incompatible with 64-bit OS.

Apps that can be categorized in multiple ways are categorized by what they are intended for; A note will be provided for compatibility issues of some very individual apps.

There is a blacklist at the end of the book containing apps that violate users' rights, security and privacy severely. These apps are to be avoided.
